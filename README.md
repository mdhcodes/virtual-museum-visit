# Virtual Museum Visit  

Virtual Museum Visit is a website that allows individuals to view artwork included in the digital Smithsonian collection.  

Users may choose to access random artwork or search based on specific criteria.  

Help make this virtual museum visit a **one-of-a-kind** learning experience for all by contributing to the code base and solving issues.  

Together, letâ€™s bring art to anyone anywhere anytime.  


This project will utilize Python, Django, and JavaScript along with other technologies as needed to create a virtual Smithsonian Museum art exhibit.

The resources for this website will be gathered from the Smithsonian Open Access Project.
